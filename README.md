# Modified Lighthouse Labs' Snake Server
This is Johannes' fork of [snek](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/snek-multiplayer) from Lighthouse Labs, which in turn is based on [snek](https://github.com/taniarascia/snek) by [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com).

I have added broadcast support for logon/logoff events, which my [snake client](https://github.com/jowe81/snake-client) takes advantage of.

Original README follows below below.
